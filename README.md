# HotspotApp

This app is used to turn on/off an open hotspot. The app uses **WifiManager** and **WifiConfiguration** classes for implementing the same.<br><br>
This is a prototype and hence the **SSID** of the hotspot is being hardcoded, otherwise it can be either generated programmatically or can be taken as input from the user.
